# notebooks

This is a repository for python notebooks for use with ipython/jupyter.  We will assume that you run this in an environment using python 3.x.  We'll include files from aima-python that are needed.  To run some of the notebooks you will have to install packages.  For example, those in the Axelrod-notebooks directory need the axelrod package, which you can install on you own computer by executing "pip install axelrod".
